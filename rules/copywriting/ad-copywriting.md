Frameworks for writing compelling ad scripts, carousel slide copy, and social media captions for Instagram Reels and static ads created with Remotion.

> "If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear."

## Before Writing

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

1. **Product/Service**: What does it do? What problem does it solve?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are they? What pain points do they have?
3. **Differentiator**: What makes this different from competitors?
4. **Desired Action**: What should viewers do after watching? (Visit link, DM, book a call)
5. **Platform**: Instagram Reels, Stories, Feed, or carousel?

## Video Ad Script Structure (4 Scenes)

### Scene 1: Hook (2-4 seconds)

The first 1-2 seconds determine if someone watches or scrolls. Use these formulas:

**Curiosity Hooks**
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens isn't what you think."
- "[Impressive result] — and it only took [surprisingly short time]."

**Problem Hooks**
- "Never [unpleasant event] again."
- "[Question highlighting the main pain point]?"
- "Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure]."

**Contrarian Hooks**
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is wrong. Here's why."
- "I stopped [common practice] and [positive result]."

**Audience Hooks**
- "[Key feature] for [target audience]."
- "You don't have to [skill/resource] to [achieve outcome]."

### Scene 2: Problem (3-5 seconds)

Articulate the viewer's problem better than they can. Create recognition.

**Openers:**
- "You know the feeling..."
- "If you're like most [role]..."
- "Every day, [audience] struggles with..."

**Structure:**
1. The specific frustration
2. The time/money/stress wasted
3. The impact on their life

### Scene 3: Solution (3-5 seconds)

Bridge from problem to your solution):

**Structure:**
1. Outcome headline (what they get)
2. How it works (1-2 sentences)
3. Proof point (number, testimonial, or example)

### Scene 4: CTA (2-4 seconds)

Specific > generic. Never use "Learn more" or "Click here."

**Strong CTAs:**
- "Book your free consultation"
- "Get your custom quote"
- "Send us a message"
- "Link in Bio for [specific thing]"

## Headline Formulas

### Outcome-Focused
- `{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}`
- `{Achieve outcome} by {how product makes it possible}`
- `Turn {input} into {outcome}`
- `[Achieve outcome] in [timeframe]`

### Problem-Focused
- `Never {unpleasant event} again`
- `{Question highlighting the main pain point}?`
- `Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure].`

### Differentiation-Focused
- `The {opposite of usual process} way to {achieve outcome}`
- `The [category] that [key differentiator]`
- `Finally, [category] that [benefit]`

### Proof-Focused
- `[Number] [people] use [product] to [outcome]`
- `{Key benefit of your product}`

## Carousel Slide Copy (5 Slides)

### Slide 1: Hook
- Bold headline using a formula above
- Subtext that creates curiosity
- "Swipe to learn more" or arrow indicator

### Slides 2-4: Content
- One key point per slide
- Headline + 2-3 bullet points maximum
- Use icons instead of plain bullets
- Benefits, not features

### Slide 5: CTA
- Recap core value proposition
- Clear call to action
- Brand logo and contact info
- Trust signals (ratings, credentials)

### Carousel Copy Rules

1. **Front-load value**: First slide must earn the swipe
2. **One idea per slide**: Don't cram multiple concepts
3. **Progressive disclosure**: Each slide builds on the last
4. **Visual hierarchy**: Headline > bullets > fine print
5. **End with action**: Last slide must tell them what to do next

---

## Social Caption Copy

### Caption Structure

```
[Hook - first line before "more" truncation]

[Body - 2-3 short paragraphs]

[CTA - what to do next]

[Hashtags - 5-10 relevant]
```

### Caption Hooks (First Line)

- Direct question: "Dealing with [problem] right now?"
- Bold statement: "[Number]% of [audience] don't know this."
- Story opener: "Last week, a client came to us with..."
- Value promise: "[Number] things you should know about [topic]:"

### Caption Length by Platform

| Platform | Optimal Length | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Instagram Reels | 50-100 chars | Short, let video do the talking |
| Instagram Feed | 150-300 chars | Hook + key info + CTA |
| Instagram Carousel | 200-400 chars | Summary + CTA |

## Writing Principles

### Do
- Use the audience's own language
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Be specific: "32% more conversions" beats "more conversions"
- Use active voice: "We fix your problem" not "Your problem is fixed by us"
- Write at a 6th-grade reading level
- Front-load key messages (viewers may scroll away)

### Don't
- Use jargon the audience doesn't use
- Make vague promises: "the best" or "world-class"
- Write walls of text (especially on video)
- Use more than one CTA per piece
- Start with your brand name (earn attention first)

---

## Transitions to Avoid (AI Tells)

These phrases signal AI-generated content and should be avoided:

- "That being said,..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "At its core,..."
- "In today's digital landscape,..."
- "When it comes to the realm of..."
- "This begs the question..."
- "Let's delve into..."

Use natural alternatives:
- "However,..." / "But,..."
- "What matters most is..."
- "Here's the thing:"
- "So what does this mean?"
