## Section Writing Tips

### Problem Section
Start with recognition, then escalate:
1. "You know the feeling..." (empathy)
2. The specific frustration (detail)
3. The time/money wasted (cost)
4. What happens if ignored (stakes)

### Solution Section
For each benefit:
1. **Headline**: The outcome they get
2. **Body**: How it works (1-2 sentences)
3. **Proof**: Number, testimonial, or example

### How It Works
Each step should be:
1. **Numbered**: Creates sense of progress
2. **Simple verb**: "Contact," "Explain," "Resolve"
3. **Outcome-oriented**: What they get from this step

Example:
1. Tell us what happened (free initial call)
2. We review your case and options
3. You decide how to proceed — no pressure
