# Social Content Strategy

Strategy for distributing Remotion-generated video and carousel content on social media, with focus on Instagram.

---

## Before Creating Content

Gather this context:

1. **Goals**: Brand awareness, leads, traffic, or community?
2. **Audience**: Who are you reaching? What platforms are they on?
3. **Brand Voice**: Professional, casual, authoritative, friendly?
4. **Resources**: How much time weekly? Video capability?
5. **Existing Content**: Blog posts, case studies, FAQs to repurpose?

## Platform Quick Reference

| Platform | Best For | Frequency | Key Format |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Instagram | Visual brands, lifestyle, services | 1-2 posts + Stories daily | Reels, carousels |
| LinkedIn | B2B, thought leadership | 3-5x/week | Carousels, stories |
| TikTok | Brand awareness, younger audiences | 1-4x/day | Short-form video |
| Facebook | Communities, local businesses | 1-2x/day | Native video, groups |

---

## Content Pillars Framework

Build content around 3-5 recurring themes. Example for a service business:

| Pillar | % of Content | Example Topics |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Educational | 35% | How-tos, explainers, common mistakes |
| Social Proof | 25% | Case studies, testimonials, results |
| Behind-the-scenes | 20% | Process, team, day-in-the-life |
| Industry Insights | 15% | Trends, news, commentary |
| Promotional | 5% | Service offers, CTAs |

---

## Content Repurposing System

Turn one Remotion video ad into multiple content pieces:

### From a 15-Second Reel

| Derivative | Platform | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Original Reel | Instagram, TikTok | Upload as-is |
| Carousel (5 slides) | Instagram Feed | Key points as slides |
| Story series | Instagram Stories | Split into 3-5 story frames |
| Quote card | Instagram Feed | Pull best line from script |
| Caption post | LinkedIn | Script adapted as text post |
| Blog section | Website | Expand topic into article |

### From a Long-Form Video (60-120s)

| Derivative | Format | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Full video | YouTube, website embed | Original |
| 15s clip | Instagram Reels, TikTok | Hook + best moment |
| 30s clip | Instagram Reels | Problem + solution condensed |
| Carousel | Instagram Feed | Key frames as slides |
| Transcript excerpt | LinkedIn post | Script as text content |
| Blog post | Website | Full topic expansion |

### Repurposing Workflow

1. **Create pillar content** (Remotion video ad)
2. **Extract key moments** (3-5 per video)
3. **Adapt per platform** (format, length, tone)
4. **Schedule across the week** (spread distribution)
5. **Update and reshare** (evergreen content can repeat monthly)

## Instagram-Specific Strategy

### What Works on Instagram

- Reels get 2x reach of static posts
- Carousels get highest saves
- First frame of Reels must hook
- Stories keep you top of feed
- Saves and shares > likes (algorithm signal)
- Consistency > perfection

### Posting Schedule

| Day | Feed | Stories |
|-----|------|---------|
| Mon | Educational Reel | Behind-the-scenes |
| Tue | — | Poll / Question |
| Wed | Carousel (case study) | Reel clip teaser |
| Thu | — | Tips / Quick advice |
| Fri | Reel (problem/solution) | CTA / Link sticker |

### Instagram Algorithm Tips

- First-hour engagement matters most
- Use all features (polls, questions, links)
- No external links in post body (kills reach)
- Consistent posting time trains the algorithm
- Engage with comments within first 30 minutes

---

## Hook Formulas for Social Posts

### Curiosity
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "[Number]% of [audience] don't know this."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens..."

### Story
- "Last week, a client came to us with..."
- "True story:"
- "This happens more often than you think:"

### Value
- "[Number] things you should know about [topic]:"
- "How to [outcome] (without [pain]):"
- "Stop [mistake]. Do this instead:"

### Contrarian
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is terrible advice. Here's why:"

## Caption Best Practices

### Structure

```
[Hook — first line before "more" truncation]

[Body — 2-3 short paragraphs, use line breaks]

[CTA — one clear action]

[Hashtags — 5-10 relevant, in comment or end of caption]
```

### Caption Length

| Content Type | Length | Why |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| Reel | 50-100 chars | Let the video do the work |
| Carousel | 200-400 chars | Context + CTA |
| Image post | 150-300 chars | Hook + key info |

### Hashtag Strategy

- Mix of broad (500K+), medium (50K-500K), and niche (5K-50K) tags
- 5-10 hashtags per post (more doesn't help)
- Create one branded hashtag
- Rotate hashtag sets to avoid shadowban

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Routine (30 min)

1. Reply to all comments on your posts (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min)
3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

### Quality Comments

- Add a new insight, not just "Great post!"
- Share a related experience
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up question
- Keep it genuine — people can tell

---

## Analytics & Optimization

### Metrics That Matter

| Category | Metric | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Reach | Impressions, Accounts reached | Content distribution |
| Engagement | Saves, Shares, Comments | Quality signal |
| Conversion | Link clicks, Profile visits, DMs | Business impact |
| Growth | Follower growth rate | Long-term health |

### Weekly Review

1. Top 3 performing posts — why did they work?
2. Bottom 3 posts — what can you learn?
3. Best posting times (from data)
4. Engagement rate trend
5. Content pillar performance comparison

### If Engagement Is Low

- Test new hooks (first line matters most)
- Post at different times
- Try different formats (Reel vs carousel)
- Increase engagement with other accounts
- Check if content matches audience expectations

### If Reach Is Declining

- Avoid external links in post body
- Increase posting frequency
- Lean into Reels (algorithm priority)
- Use all interactive features (polls, Q&A)
- Engage more in comments (first 30 min)

## Scheduling

### Schedule vs Post Live

| Schedule | Post Live |
|----------|-----------|
| Core content posts | Real-time commentary |
| Carousels, Reels | Trend responses |
| Evergreen content | Engagement with others |

### Queue Management

- Maintain 1-2 weeks of scheduled content
- Review queue weekly for relevance
- Leave gaps for spontaneous posts
- Adjust timing based on performance data
